a) try and check where these operators appear
	-live query statistics
	-order by, where , join's
	-when you use order by, it doesn t matter what you have after select
	-if you use where and join, it is important^
	-no more than 4 queries are needed

b)select ...
from Tb where b2=some value

-execute first w/out any index

-than create an index on b2 non clustered, then execute again
-if you don't see any differrences, add records
-it is important what fields you have in the select

c)create a select and save in a view
-select ... from tb inner join tb on tb.bid=tc.cid
execute view
-create non clustered index on the fk
execute view
-in views you cannot have order by

conclusion:
create 3 tables with the specified structure
a)check w/ live query statistics select with order by, where, join
you will have to create non clustered index '
b)..
c)..
