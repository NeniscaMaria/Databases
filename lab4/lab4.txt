->test:-delete/insert from table and evaluate view
->tests for at least 3 tables and at least 3 views
->create view V1 as
	select Name
	from Student
go
--select * from V1--

->create view V2 as
	select G.Gid,S.name
	from Groups G inner join Students S on G.Gid=S>SId
	where noOfStudents>20
go
--select* from V2--(operation to evaluate the view)

->view = a virtual table

->In the following tables you have to add only once (at the beginning)
	-Tables table :-tid=identity
			-name=the tables considered
	-Views table:-exactly the same as above
	-Tests table:-name of test : ex: Del/Ins t_name Ev v_name
	-TestViews table:-the viewID same as the view used in the Tests table at the id=TVid
	-TestTables table:-noOfRows:-how many rows we want to insert in the table used in the test
			-position:-position in the "rank"-order of deletion
				ex: 1-ST
				    2-Student
				    3-Group
				    4-Teacher
